Project Overview: Data Correction and Visualization

Objective:
The goal of this Python project is to process an Excel workbook, specifically the 'Sheet1' of the workbook, by adjusting prices and adding a bar chart to visualize the corrected prices.

Libraries Used:
- `openpyxl`: A library for reading and writing Excel files.
- `openpyxl.chart`: A submodule for creating charts in Excel using openpyxl.

Function: `process_workbook(filename)`
-   Parameters:
  - `filename`: The name or path of the Excel file to be processed.

Workflow:
  1. Load the workbook using `openpyxl`.
  2. Access the 'Sheet1' within the workbook.
  3. Iterate through each row starting from the 2nd row (skipping the header).
  4. Retrieve the value in the 3rd column of the current row (assuming 1st column is A, 2nd is B, etc.).
  5. Calculate a corrected price by reducing the original price by 10% (multiplying by 0.9).
  6. Update the value in the 4th column of the current row with the corrected price.
  7. Define a data range (Reference) for the corrected prices.
  8. Create a BarChart using the corrected prices data.
  9. Add the chart to the sheet starting at cell 'e2'.
  10. Save the modified workbook.

Example Usage:
  ```python
  process_workbook('your_excel_file.xlsx')
  ```

Note:
- Ensure that the Excel file has a sheet named 'Sheet1'.
- This project assumes that the original prices are in the 3rd column, and the corrected prices will be placed in the 4th column.
- Adjust the column indices and chart location as needed based on your specific Excel file structure.
